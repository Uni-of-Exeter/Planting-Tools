# Planting-Tools project

## Instructions for contributors
- Never try to push to the `master` branch, only to your own branch. If you try anyway, the admin (Daniel, and Timothée for now) will deny it.
- Currently, you can only make a Pull Request to your own branch, this restriction may be lifted in the future.
- Once you are happy with your branch and want to share your changes with everybody, make a Pull Request to the `dev` branch. Daniel (or Timothée for now) will process it.
- Once in a while, when `dev` is stable enough, `master` will be updated.
- When working, you need to pull changes from `dev` fairly often (especially before pushing to `dev`), because you may have conflicts when you try to push to `dev` if e.g. someone else worked on the same file as you did. Dealing with file conflicts late can cost you a decent amount of time.
- Add some details in the commits and Pull Requests, this is very useful for everyone to understand what you did. This will also let you search more easily in the future.
