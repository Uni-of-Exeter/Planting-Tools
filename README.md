# Planting-Tools: TODO
# 1- Area Target should be changed to below instead of above. Then in the display, we should find a way to represent the direction of the target. We should also change the code related to the implausibility
# 2- reduce code size by created functions. Some of the code is repeated. some parts could be included in functions that are then called.
# 3- at the moment, the 4 variables are hard coded. The code could be restructured to allow any number of variables/targets that could be above/below (or between, maybe?)
# 4- how do we obtain the perplexity for the tsne based on the number of points:

# 5- improve the tsne + clustering/visualization
